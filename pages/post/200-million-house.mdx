    <title>200 million and want a house</title>
</Head>

Let’s say I have IDR 200 million, It’s a good idea to use it as a down payment?

## House Price
in Yogyakarta, you can have a decent home with a price of around 700.000.000

## Calculate Mortgage
I will use the BTN rate for this calculation

<ImagePost src="/200-million-house/btn.png"/>

- **200.000.000** as a down payment
- Tenor mortgage for **8 years**
- **6.75%** fixed interest for 2 year
- **13%** floating interest for 6 years

Using the simulasi_kpr feature from BTN Properti I got

- 2-year monthly installment: **5.864.026**
- 6-year monthly installment: **7.495.300**

If we calculate monthly installment using averagely weighted we got

- **7.291.391** monthly installment

# Alternative: Use 200.000.000 as an investment

## Future investment of 200.000.000

If I use 200.000.000 to invest with a yearly investment return of **15%,** I got **611,804,573**

## **Future Home Price**

With assumption, the housing inflation rate at **6%**, in **8 years** (same with mortgage tenor). using the future value formula, the house price become **1,115,693,652**

## Monthly Save

- Future House Price: **1,115,693,652**
- Future Investment: **611,804,573**
- Need to save: **503,889,080**
Using the PMT formula with parameter

- 15% yearly investment return
- 8 years period
We got **3,059,030** targets monthly to save

## Rent Price

I need to live somewhere right?

so if I go without a mortgage, I need to rent someplace, currently my monthly rent at **2.000.000**, with the assumption monthly rate increase by **30%** after 4 years, we got monthly rent at **2.600.000**

so the average monthly rate in 8 years is **2.300.000**

## Monthly Payment

if we add monthly save and rent price we got **5,359,030**

# Conclusion

With assumption

- House inflation: 6%
- Return on investment: 15%
- Mortgage fix 6.75% (2 Year)
- Mortgage floating 13% (6 Year)

We got monthly expenses:

- mortgage: **7.291.391**
- investment: **5,359,030**
